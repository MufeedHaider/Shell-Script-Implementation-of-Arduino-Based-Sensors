# Shell-Script-Implementation-of-Arduino-Based-Sensors
This repository contains an Arduino sketch for reading temperature from a DHT11 sensor and a Bash script for processing the data. The script logs temperatures, checks if they fall within an acceptable range, and issues a warning if too many unacceptable readings are detected.
